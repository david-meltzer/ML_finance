# ML_finance

This repository contains various notebooks where we use methods from machine learning (ML) to understand financial datasets. At the moment, this repo contains two folders, **coursera** and **workspace**. In the **coursera** folder I included three exercises from this <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/reinforcement-learning-in-finance?specialization=machine-learning-reinforcement-finance">course</a> which covers applications of Reinforcement Learning to finance. Specifically, I included the three exercises which explain how reformulate the problem of pricing an option using Q-Learning. The basic ideas behind these notebooks can be found in the following <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04609.pdf">paper</a> from Igor Halperin. In the **workspace** folder I included one notebooks where we compute the Sharpe ratio for the Amazon and Facebook stock.

This repo is a work in progress and more notebooks will be coming soon!
